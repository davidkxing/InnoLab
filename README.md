# InnoLab Raspberry Pi Arcade Game

## Overview

- Inno_Core:
	contains the sourcecode of our libretro core. Maybe a game sourcefile code will follow.

- Inno_Sprints: 
	Sprint Review Protocols from all semesters

## Future Plans
- at the moment a .dll core ist used in windows. For further use on the Raspberry Pi, a change to .so core is necessary.
- **discuss with project supervisor if a direct implementation of the game and core is possible. For seperating the core and game, there is not enough documentation and knowledge. The idea was to create a specific ROM or any other image for our core.**
